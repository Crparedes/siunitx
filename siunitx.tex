\begin{abstract}
  Physical quantities have both numbers and units, and each physical quantity
  should be expressed as the product of a number and a unit. Typesetting
  physical quantities requires care to ensure that the combined mathematical
  meaning of the number--unit combination is clear. In particular, the SI units
  system lays down a consistent set of units with rules on how these are to be
  used. However, different countries and publishers have differing conventions
  on the exact appearance of numbers (and units). The \pkg{siunitx} package
  provides a set of tools for authors to typeset quantities in a consistent
  way. The package has an extended set of configuration options which make it
  possible to follow varying typographic conventions with the same input
  syntax. The package includes automated processing of numbers and units, and
  the ability to control tabular alignment of numbers.

\section{Introduction}

The correct application of units of measurement is very important in technical
applications. For this reason, carefully-crafted definitions of a coherent
units system have been laid down by the \foreign{Conf\'erence G\'en\'erale des
Poids et Mesures} (CGPM): this has resulted in the \foreign{Syst\`eme
International d'Unit\'es}~(SI). At the same time, typographic conventions for
correctly displaying both numbers and units exist to ensure that no loss of
meaning occurs in printed matter.

The \pkg{siunitx} package aims to provide a unified method for \LaTeX{} users
to typeset numbers and units correctly and easily. The design philosophy of
\pkg{siunitx} is to follow the agreed rules by default, but to allow variation
through option settings. In this way, users can use \pkg{siunitx} to follow the
requirements of publishers, co-authors, universities, \foreign{etc}.\ without
needing to alter the input at all.

\section{Using the \pkg{siunitx} package}

\subsection{Numbers}

\DescribeMacro{\num}
\begin{syntax}
  \cs{num}\oarg{options}\marg{number}
\end{syntax}
Numbers are automatically formatted by the \cs{num} macro. This takes one
optional argument, \meta{options}, and one mandatory one, \meta{number}. The
contents of \meta{number} are automatically formatted. The formatter removes
both \enquote{soft} (\verb*" ") and \enquote{hard} spaces ("\," and "~"),
automatically identifies exponents (as standard marked using "e", "E", "d" or
"D") and adds the appropriate spacing of large numbers. With the standard
settings a leading zero is added before a decimal marker, if needed: both "."
and "," are recognised as decimal markers.
\begin{LaTeXdemo}
  \num{123}     \\
  \num{1234}    \\
  \num{12345}   \\
  \num{0.123}   \\
  \num{0,1234}  \\
  \num{.12345}  \\
  \num{3.45d-4} \\
  \num{-e10}
\end{LaTeXdemo}

Note that numbers are parsed before typesetting, which does have a performance
overhead (only obvious with very large amounts of numerical input). The parser
understands a range of input syntaxes, as demonstrated above.

\subsection{Units}

\DescribeMacro{\unit}
\begin{syntax}
  \cs{unit}\oarg{options}\marg{unit}
\end{syntax}
The symbol for a unit can be typeset using the \cs{unit} macro: this provides
full control over output format for the unit. Like the \cs{num} macro,
\cs{unit} takes one optional and one mandatory argument. The unit formatting
system can accept two types of input. When the \meta{unit} contains literal
items (for example letters or numbers) then \pkg{siunitx} converts \texttt{.}
and "~" into inter-unit product and correctly positions sub- and superscripts
specified using "_" and "^". The formatting methods will work with both math
and text mode.
\begin{LaTeXdemo}
  \unit{kg.m/s^2} \\
  \unit{g_{polymer}~mol_{cat}.s^{-1}}
\end{LaTeXdemo}

The second operation mode for the \cs{unit} macro is an \enquote{interpreted}
system, Here, each unit, SI multiple prefix and power is given a macro name.
These are entered in a method very similar to the reading of the unit name in
English.
\begin{LaTeXdemo}
  \unit{\kilo\gram\metre\per\square\second} \\
  \unit{\gram\per\cubic\centi\metre}        \\
  \unit{\square\volt\cubic\lumen\per\farad} \\
  \unit{\metre\squared\per\gray\cubic\lux}  \\
  \unit{\henry\second}
\end{LaTeXdemo}

On its own, this is less convenient than the direct method, although it does
use meaning rather than appearance for input. However, the package allows you
to define new unit macros; a large number of pre-defined abbreviations are also
supplied. More importantly, by defining macros for units, instead of literal
input, new functionality is made available. By altering the settings used by
the package, the same input can yield a variety of different output formats.
For example, the \cs{per} macro can give reciprocal powers, slashes or be used
to construct units as fractions.

\DescribeMacro{\qty}
\begin{syntax}
  \cs{qty}\oarg{options}\marg{number}\marg{unit}
\end{syntax}
Very often, numbers and units are given together. Formally, the value of a
quantity is the product of the number and the unit, the space being regarded as
a multiplication sign \cite{SI:5.3.3}. The \cs{SI} macro combines the
functionality of \cs{num} and \cs{unit}, and makes this both possible and easy.
The \meta{number} and \meta{unit} arguments work exactly like those for the
\cs{num} and \cs{unit} macros, respectively.
\begin{LaTeXdemo}
  \qty{1.23}{J.mol^{-1}.K^{-1}}                            \\
  \qty{.23e7}{\candela}                                    \\
  \qty[unit/per-mode = symbol]{1.99}{\per\kilogram}        \\
  \qty[unit/per-mode = fraction]{1,345}{\coulomb\per\mole}
\end{LaTeXdemo}

It is possible to set up the unit macros to be available outside of the
\cs{qty} and \cs{unit} functions. This is not the standard behaviour as there
is the risk of name clashes (for example, \cs{bar} is used by other packages,
and several packages define \cs{degree}). Full details of using \enquote{stand
alone} units are found in \ref{sec:units:creating}.

\section{Installation}

For most users, there will be no need to explicitly install \pkg{siunitx}:
it is available from the package management system in current \TeX{} Live
and MiK\TeX{} systems.

For manual installation, the package is available from
\href{http://ctan.org/pkg/siunitx}{\acro{ctan}}. As well as the raw source
files, \acro{ctan} hold the package as a pre-extracted zip file,
\file{siunitx.tds.zip}. The later is most convenient for most users: simply
unzip this in your local \path{texmf} directory.

The package requires \LaTeX3 support as provided in the \pkg{l3kernel} and
\pkg{l3packages} bundles. Both of these are included in \TeX{} Live and
MiK\TeX{}, or are again available in ready-to-install form from \acro{ctan}.

\section{Thanks}

Many users have provided feedback, bug reports and ideas for new features for
\pkg{siunitx}: thanks to all of them. Particular thanks to Stefan Pinnow, who
has taken the lead role as beta tester for \pkg{siunitx}, finding incorrect
output, bad documentation and the odd spelling mistake in the documentation.
Thanks also to Enrico Gregorio for encouraging me to complete a fully
\pkg{expl3}-compliant version of the package. Thanks also to Danie Els and
Marcel Heldoorn for the \pkg{SIstyle} and \pkg{SIunits} packages, respectively,
which provided the starting point for the development of \pkg{siunitx}.

\section{Making suggestions and reporting bugs}

Feedback on \pkg{siunitx} is always welcome, either to make suggestions or to
report problems. When sending feedback, it is always useful if a small example
file is included, showing the bug being reported or illustrating the desired
output. It is helpful if a \enquote{reference rendering} is included, showing
what the output should look like. A typical example file might read
\begin{verbatim}
  \listfiles
  % Use the article class unless the problem is class-dependent
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{siunitx}
  % Other packages loaded as required
  \begin{document}
  Reference output: $1.23\,\mathrm{m}$

  siunitx output: \SI{1.23}{\metre}
  \end{document}
\end{verbatim}
As illustrated, it is usually best to use the \cls{article} class and to only
load packages which are needed to show the issue. It is also useful to include
a copy of the log file generate by \LaTeX{} when reporting a bug (as the
versions of packages can be important to solving the issue).

Feedback can be sent in a range of ways. The development code and issue tracker
are hosted on \href{https://github.com/josephwright/siunitx/}{GitHub}. Issues
opened there are visible to other users and makes sure that they cannot be
forgotten.
