\begin{abstract}
  Physical quantities have both numbers and units, and each physical quantity
  should be expressed as the product of a number and a unit. Typesetting
  physical quantities requires care to ensure that the combined mathematical
  meaning of the number--unit combination is clear. In particular, the SI units
  system lays down a consistent set of units with rules on how these are to be
  used. However, different countries and publishers have differing conventions
  on the exact appearance of numbers (and units).

  The \pkg{siunitx} package provides a set of tools for authors to typeset
  quantities in a consistent way. The package has an extended set of
  configuration options which make it possible to follow varying typographic
  conventions with the same input syntax. The package includes automated
  processing of numbers and units, and the ability to control tabular alignment
  of numbers.

\section{Introduction}

The correct application of units of measurement is very important in technical
applications. For this reason, carefully-crafted definitions of a coherent
units system have been laid down by the \foreign{Conf\'erence G\'en\'erale des
Poids et Mesures} (CGPM): this has resulted in the \foreign{Syst\`eme
International d'Unit\'es}~(SI). At the same time, typographic conventions for
correctly displaying both numbers and units exist to ensure that no loss of
meaning occurs in printed matter.

The \pkg{siunitx} package aims to provide a unified method for \LaTeX{} users
to typeset numbers and units correctly and easily. The design philosophy of
\pkg{siunitx} is to follow the agreed rules by default, but to allow variation
through option settings. In this way, users can use \pkg{siunitx} to follow the
requirements of publishers, co-authors, universities, \foreign{etc}.\ without
needing to alter the input at all.

\section{Thanks}

Many users have provided feedback, bug reports and ideas for new features for
\pkg{siunitx}: thanks to all of them. Particular thanks to Stefan Pinnow, who
has taken the lead role as beta tester for \pkg{siunitx}, finding incorrect
output, bad documentation and the odd spelling mistake in the documentation.
Thanks also to Enrico Gregorio for encouraging me to complete a fully
\pkg{expl3}-compliant version of the package. Thanks also to Danie Els and
Marcel Heldoorn for the \pkg{SIstyle} and \pkg{SIunits} packages, respectively,
which provided the starting point for the development of \pkg{siunitx}.

\section{Making suggestions and reporting bugs}

Feedback on \pkg{siunitx} is always welcome, either to make suggestions or to
report problems. When sending feedback, it is always useful if a small example
file is included, showing the bug being reported or illustrating the desired
output. It is helpful if a \enquote{reference rendering} is included, showing
what the output should look like. A typical example file might read
\begin{verbatim}
  \listfiles
  % Use the article class unless the problem is class-dependent
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{siunitx}
  % Other packages loaded as required
  \begin{document}
  Reference output: $1.23\,\mathrm{m}$

  siunitx output: \SI{1.23}{\metre}
  \end{document}
\end{verbatim}
As illustrated, it is usually best to use the \cls{article} class and to only
load packages which are needed to show the issue. It is also useful to include
a copy of the log file generate by \LaTeX{} when reporting a bug (as the
versions of packages can be important to solving the issue).

Feedback can be sent in a range of ways. The development code and issue tracker
are hosted on \href{https://github.com/josephwright/siunitx/}{GitHub}. Issues
opened there are visible to other users and makes sure that they cannot be
forgotten. E-mailing \email{joseph.wright@morningstar2.co.uk} directly will
also definitely get attention.
